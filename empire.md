Empire is a post-exploitation framework with a pure-PowerShell 2.0 Windows agent and a pure Python 2.6/2.7 Linux/OS X agent. It is the merge of the previous PowerShell Empire and Python EmPyre projects. The framework offers cryptological-secure communications and a flexible architecture. On the PowerShell side, Empire implements the ability to run PowerShell agents without needing powershell.exe, rapidly deployable post-exploitation modules ranging from key loggers to Mimikatz, and adaptable communications to evade network detection, all wrapped up in a usability-focused framework. PowerShell Empire premiered at BSidesLV in 2015, and Python EmPyre premiered at HackMiami in 2016.  
   
The project was retired in 2019, but the code is still available for reference. You can learn more about the end of the project here: <https://mobile.twitter.com/specterops/status/1156650932421050368>
