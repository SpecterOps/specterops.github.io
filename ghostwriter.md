Ghostwriter is a part of your team. It helps you manage clients, projects, reports, and infrastructure in one application. It does not replace some of the more common or traditional project management tools, such as CRMs. Still, it does consolidate all relevant project information in a way for users to easily curate every aspect of their projects.
