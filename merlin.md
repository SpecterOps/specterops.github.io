Merlin is a cross-platform post-exploitation Command & Control server and agent written in Go. Both components can be
compiled to run on any platform. A server compiled to run on Linux, or any platform, can handle agents compiled for all
other platforms. You can use the Merlin server and agent on its own or install Merlin as an agent in Mythic, a
collaborative, multi-platform, and multi-agent red teaming framework.
